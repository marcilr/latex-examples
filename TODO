+++ Mar 26, 2010 - Reverted to dist-build.xml project name of 'latex-examples'.
Had to since it is used for the distribution tarball name.  Abstract the project 
name to the VERSION file?  Better way to eliminate this hardcoded value?

The build.xml inherits the project name from the *.tex.in filename.  
Perhaps dist-build.xml should do the same for consistency?  Problem with
this idea is if multiple *.tex.in files were being built it would break.

+++ Mar 26, 2010 - Replaced one use of sed with simpler cut statement.  Don't think there is
any simple way to replace search-n-replace sed use.  Sould use autotools or
awk but that is the antithesis of simpler. 
Mar 25, 2010 - Remove use of sed from Makefile.

Complete
========
x Mar 25, 2010 - Updated Makefile and build.xml to append version to basename of pdf.
Embed version number in resultant pdf filename.
    Of course this means modifying the GNU Makefile and ant build.xml

x Mar 25, 2010 - Made build.xml and dist-build.xml abstract.  Makefile was good.
Make build files abstract for reuse.  No need to embed project name 
on these files.

x Mar 25, 2010 - Created DEPENDENCIES file.
Create DEPENDENCIES or INSTALL file with software dependencies used
to create document.

x Mar 1, 2010 - Updated ant build.xml with VERSION functionality.
The build.xml does not do the example.tex.in @VERSION@ replacement not 
copy the file to examples.tex for document build.
